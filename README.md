# Hi

## Who are you?

I'm Huy and please don't mistakenly refer to me by my family name or middle
name.  In Vietnamese family name comes first and given name comes last; see
also [Vietnamese name on Wikipedia][wp], [Falsehoods programmers believe about
names][false], as well as [W3C internationalization guidelines on names][w3c].

## Why aren't you active here?

There are various reasons for me to be refrained from using GitHub.  While I
haven't written an article on that myself, [someone else has given various
reasons that pretty much overlap mine][lanodan].  [GitHub
scraping the source code][pilot] was another reason.

[pilot]: https://drewdevault.com/2022/06/23/Copilot-GPL-washing.html

While I still keep this account to contribute to other projects that remained
here, I have moved my activity to [sourcehut][srht].

Another reason that my activity has been low is that I had been a full-time
employee.  I find it unreasonable that some recruiters seek people who have
professional experience (which usually mean they write private code for their
employer) and expect their GitHub profile to have much activity at all.

## Where to find me

Besides the linked sourcehut page, I also have a website, and as you're here
you probably want to read about [my works][work] first.
